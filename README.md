Type in this command (I assume you already have python installed):
```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```
in python 2.7 or 
```shell
python -m http.server 8888
```
in Python 3.

Run your browser and type in the address: http://localhost:8888 and you should see the local files and folders where you start your browser.
